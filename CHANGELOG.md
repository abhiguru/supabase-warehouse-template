# Changelog

## Unreleased — second-pass review

- Corrected readiness claims: fresh migrations and mobile API coverage fail;
  setup/start and future releases are gated pending a complete sanitized export.
- Added isolated migration/contract tests, credential-preservation and JWT/profile
  regression tests, Compose ownership checks, and explicit readiness documentation.
- Hardened custom-auth function checks and corrected public configuration URLs.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
